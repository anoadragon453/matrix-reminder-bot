# Contributing to matrix-reminder-bot

Thank you for taking interest in this little project. Below is some information
to help you with contributing.

## Setting up your development environment

### Using `docker-compose`

It is **recommended** to use Docker Compose to run matrix-reminder-bot while
developing, as all necessary dependencies are handled for you. After
installation and ensuring the `docker-compose` command works, you need to:

1. Create a data directory and config file by following the
   [docker setup instructions](docker#setup).

2. Create a docker volume pointing to that directory:

   ```
   docker volume create \
     --opt type=none \
     --opt o=bind \
     --opt device="/path/to/data/dir" data_volume
   ```

Run `docker/start-dev.sh` to start the bot.

**Note:** If you are trying to connect to a Synapse instance running on the
host, you need to allow the IP address of the docker container to connect. This
is controlled by `bind_addresses` in the `listeners` section of Synapse's
config. If present, either add the docker internal IP address to the list, or
remove the option altogether to allow all addresses.

### Running natively

If you would rather not or are unable to run docker, please follow the Native
Installation, Configuration and Running sections in the
[project readme](README.md#native-installation).

## Development dependencies

There are some python dependencies that are required for linting/testing etc.
You can install them with:

```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Code style

Please follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style
guidelines and format your import statements with
[isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/).

## Linting

Run the following script to automatically format your code. This *should* make
the linting CI happy:

```
./scripts-dev/lint.sh
```

## What to work on

Take a look at the [issues
list](https://github.com/anoadragon453/matrix-reminder-bot/issues). What
feature would you like to see or bug do you want to be fixed?
